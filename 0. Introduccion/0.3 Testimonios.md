# 0.3 Testimonials
This chapter is about testimonials from engineers all over the world. They have all used The Standard in their daily projects and benefited from it. Here's their testimonials:

---

<i>"The Standard is free knowledge, it taught me things about Software engineering more than school.
Knowing the correct naming conventions and keeping a virtual code map in your head is really helpful.
You know in your head (UI/API -> Service -> Broker -> Database)
It made me know what I want to do and draw my architecture before I start writing code. Knowing what is where is very important here.
It is blazor friendly and I have adapted most of the standard basics in my Pre-Master Graduation project. 
I intend to learn the Standard as I see it evolve and adapt more libraries and I love the idea of Hassan creating his own Dotnet Libraries.
I am still learning the standard, But I hope one day I fully adapt it in one of my big projects and libraries." </i>

<i> "Better internal and cross team collaboration. Less meetings and churn with conversations like “tabs vs spaces”.  Common set of concepts and buzzwords to facilitate communication and collaboration.  PRs, continuous integration/feedback and engineering quality become automatic. Easily one of the best ways to remove the roadblocks that inhibit new teams." </i>

<i> "The Standard takes out the ambiguity that comes with writing code. It takes into consideration many edge cases and threats which go unseen so many times in SDL. It is developer friendly and gives the flexibility of anyone working on any service/product if it uses The Standard. My team can take vacation and the work will still go on as if that same engineer is writing the code." </i>

<i> "The Standard, according to me should be every engineer's toolkit. It unravels some common assumptions, unknowns and silent doubts that would come to every engineer's mind but end up staying inside unanswered. This living document should be adopted broadly worldwide to an extent that it becomes the common language for software development making it easier to people to collaborate and bring qualitatively engineered products to life." </i>

<i> "Provided a framework for engineers to grow within. Inspired engineers to think more on design and architecture within the source code, not just the application resource topology. Taught engineers to think of the developer experience (onboarding, readability, maintainability) beyond their immediate project."</i>

<i> "The Standard helped me transition from intimidated to empowered, as I sought out to create a system strong enough to support my goals. Envisioning the product and the UI was the easy part - knowing how to tie everything together in a way that would allow the product to continue evolving seemed impossible. Hassan's blueprint has given me clarity, motivated me to use best practices, and enabled me to create software that will scale appropriately." </i>

<i> "Relaunching my career as a software engineer having left it for almost 15 years, The Standard helps me to quickly regain confidence and skills in coding and software design. The Standard removes ambiguity and applies SOLID principles elegantly. It also speaks to me on many levels, personally and professionally, through its observation of the world and everything in it." </i>

<i> "The-Standard gave me hope, enriched my knowledge and enabled me build highly-profitable apps. If you think this is the next tech-book on how to write "good" software, you are utterly mistaken. Personally, The-Standard taught me the craft of software engineering, like topics ranging from effective team management to proper commit history." </i>

<i> "It allowed me to introduce structure within my hobby projects. It lends itself to a test driven approach which has helped plug gaps in projects at work. Though the terminology used has taken time to getting used to, it allows an easy way to communicate new ideas between each other." </i>
